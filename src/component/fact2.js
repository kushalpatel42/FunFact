        <p>Shells left over after lobster processing are usually tossed into landfills. So in an effort to make them worth something and keep the money in the lobster industry, a University of Maine professor created golf balls with a core made out of lobster shells. Theyâ€™re also biodegradable, designed for golfing on cruise ships or courses near oceans and lakes!</p>
